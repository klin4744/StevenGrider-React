What is React and what is its purpose?
React is a Javascript library that aims to show content (HTML) to users and handle user interaction 

Why didn't we use Redux to make a simple app?
React works well by itself but it can also work with a tremendous variety of other libraries, packages, servers, and databases. 

What is a Javascript class?
Javascript class are a part of ES2015 that attaches syntax to javascript that somewhat replicates classes in other languages, not fully. 

React components are made using either Javascript functions or classes 

What is JSX?
JSX is a special javascript dialect that tells React how it should render a component. It is compiled into regular javascript by babel. 

The React library contains javascript code that knows what a component is and how to make the components work together

The ReactDOM library will take these components and render them onto the DOM 

Babel
Not all browsers support the newer versions of javascript, especially not ES2016+. To get around this, we can use a compiler like babel which will convert our code to older ES5 code which is supported by every browser!
